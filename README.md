# Guide

## Goal
Your objective is to gain as many points as you can by placing blocks on a board.

## Rules
Each round you get **three blocks** which you have to place on the board.

A **round** begins when you get these three blocks and ends when they're all gone.

However, sometimes there's no space left on the board for a particular block to be placed. Thus, you can **switch** blocks you have to place (*this will be removed in future versions*).

When you line up eight squares vertically or horizontally you "**strike**". These eight squares are removed from the board, you get 8 points and your "combo" rises.

**Combo** is for how many rounds in a row you've had strikes. It is a multiplier for points you get, e.g. your combo is 3 so for another strike instead of 8, you get 3 * 8 = 24 points.

## Menu
To start a new game, click the green button with your mouse.

After that, a new game begins.

In the top left corner, near the crown icon, you can see your highscore. 

In the middle, written with a bigger font is your current score. 

The green circle on the topright allows you to restart the game.

At the bottom are blocks which you have to put on the board.

## Controls

### Putting blocks on board
To grab a block, hover on it and press LMB. If you change your mind, hover on anywhere besides the board and press LMB. To place it, hover on the spot you want to put the block on and press LMB.

### Switching blocks to place
Press "P" on your keyboard when you want to switch the blocks you have to place.
